# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This section addresses common questions students and instructors might have about the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook" and its content.

---

**Q: What is the primary target audience for this textbook?**
A: This textbook is designed for university students (BS/BE in Robotics, AI, Computer Science), engineers, and professionals with a foundational background in Python programming and Linux command-line usage. It can also serve as official course material for instructors teaching Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics courses.

---

**Q: Do I need prior experience with ROS 2, Gazebo, or NVIDIA Isaac?**
A: No prior experience with these specific tools is required. The textbook is structured to guide you from foundational concepts through hands-on labs for each tool. However, a general understanding of programming (Python) and Linux is assumed.

---

**Q: What hardware is required to follow the labs in this textbook?**
A: A high-performance workstation with a powerful NVIDIA GPU (RTX 3060 or newer, 8GB+ VRAM recommended) is highly recommended, especially for NVIDIA Isaac Sim. Minimum RAM is 32GB, but 64GB is preferred. All labs are designed to run on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Please refer to the [Hardware & Software Requirements](hardware-requirements.md) section for detailed specifications.

---

**Q: Can I use a cloud-based environment instead of local hardware?**
A: Yes, cloud alternatives like AWS RoboMaker or NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud can be used, but be aware of potential latency issues and associated costs. Local setup is generally recommended for the best hands-on experience.

---

**Q: Is this textbook suitable for learning about ROS 1?**
A: No, this textbook exclusively focuses on ROS 2 (Humble/Iron) due to its modern architecture, real-time capabilities, and suitability for complex robotic systems. ROS 1 content is explicitly out of scope.

---

**Q: Will the textbook cover ethical implications of humanoid robotics?**
A: While ethical considerations are acknowledged as important and are briefly referenced within discussions, a dedicated in-depth ethics section is out of scope for this textbook.

---

**Q: Are the code examples and labs fully reproducible?**
A: Yes, a core principle of this textbook is reproducibility. All code examples and lab instructions are designed and validated to run successfully on the specified Ubuntu 22.04 environment with the recommended software versions.

---

**Q: How is optional or advanced content handled?**
A: Optional content, such as advanced topics or alternative approaches, is clearly marked within chapters (using "Optional" admonitions) or placed in separate appendix chapters to enrich the learning experience without disrupting the core curriculum.

---

**Q: What kind of guidance is provided for the Capstone Project?**
A: The Capstone Project follows a hybrid guidance model, offering high-level goals, key milestones, and architectural suggestions, while encouraging students to independently apply their learned skills to implement specific solutions.

---

**Q: Will there be troubleshooting guides for common issues?**
A: Yes, each module/chapter includes dedicated troubleshooting guides or FAQ sections to help address common issues related to environment setup, software configuration, and lab execution.
