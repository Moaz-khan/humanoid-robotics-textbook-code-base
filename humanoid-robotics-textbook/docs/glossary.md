# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms and concepts used throughout the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook." Understanding these terms is essential for comprehending the material.

---

**Action (ROS 2)**
: A high-level, goal-oriented ROS 2 communication mechanism used for long-running tasks. It provides a goal, continuous feedback, and a final result.

**AMENT**
: The build system used by ROS 2 packages, replacing Catkin from ROS 1.

**Autonomous Navigation**
: The ability of a robot to determine its own position, plan a path to a target, and execute that path while avoiding obstacles, without continuous human intervention.

**Bipedal Robot**
: A robot that moves on two legs, mimicking human locomotion. This presents significant challenges in balance and control.

**Capstone Project**
: A culminating project that allows students to apply and integrate knowledge and skills acquired throughout a course or program.

**Client (ROS 2)**
: In the context of ROS 2 services, a node that sends a request to a service server and waits for a reply.

**`colcon`**
: A command-line tool used for building, testing, and installing multiple software packages, especially in ROS 2.

**Controller Server (Nav2)**
: A component of the Nav2 stack responsible for local path planning and executing control commands to move the robot while avoiding immediate obstacles.

**Digital Twin**
: A virtual representation or model of a physical object, system, or process, updated with real-time data to enable simulation, analysis, and monitoring.

**Docusaurus**
: A static site generator that helps you build, deploy, and maintain open source project websites easily.

**Gazebo**
: A powerful 3D robot simulator that accurately simulates populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments.

**Grounding (VLA)**
: The process of connecting abstract linguistic concepts (words, phrases) to concrete perceptions and actions in a robot's physical environment.

**Humanoid Robot**
: A robot with a body shape built to resemble that of the human body, often with a torso, head, two arms, and two legs.

**Isaac ROS**
: A collection of hardware-accelerated ROS 2 packages from NVIDIA that provide high-performance modules for perception, navigation, and manipulation.

**Isaac Sim**
: NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated robotics simulation application built on the Omniverse platform, offering photorealistic rendering and synthetic data generation.

**Joint (URDF)**
: An element in a URDF file that describes the kinematic and dynamic connection between two `link` elements of a robot.

**Kinematics**
: The study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. In robotics, it deals with the geometry of robot motion (e.g., forward and inverse kinematics).

**Large Language Model (LLM)**
: A type of artificial intelligence program that can generate and understand human language, often based on deep learning architectures like transformers.

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**
: A remote sensing method that uses pulsed laser light to measure distances to the Earth or target objects, creating 3D point clouds.

**Link (URDF)**
: An element in a URDF file that represents a rigid body segment of a robot, with properties like mass, visual appearance, and collision geometry.

**Localization**
: The process by which a robot determines its own position and orientation within a given map.

**Mapping**
: The process by which a robot builds a representation (map) of its surrounding environment.

**Message (ROS 2)**
: A data structure used by ROS 2 topics to transfer information between nodes.

**Middleware**
: Software that provides services to applications beyond those available from the operating system, enabling communication and data management. ROS 2 is a form of robotics middleware.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
: A field of artificial intelligence concerned with the interaction between computers and human language.

**Navigation2 (Nav2)**
: The ROS 2 framework for autonomous navigation, providing a full software stack including localization, path planning, and control.

**Node (ROS 2)**
: An executable process in ROS 2 that performs a single, modular computation.

**NVIDIA Omniverse**
: A platform for connecting and building 3D applications and workflows. Isaac Sim is built on Omniverse.

**Parameter (ROS 2)**
: Dynamic configuration values for ROS 2 nodes that can be set at runtime.

**Path Planning**
: The process of finding an optimal or feasible path for a robot to move from a start location to a goal location, avoiding obstacles.

**Physical AI**
: Artificial intelligence systems integrated into physical bodies, allowing them to perceive, reason, and act within the real world.

**Publisher (ROS 2)**
: A ROS 2 node that sends messages to a specific topic.

**Quality of Service (QoS)**
: A set of policies in ROS 2 (DDS) that allow developers to configure the reliability, latency, and other characteristics of data communication.

**Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)**
: An open-source, flexible framework for writing robot software, providing tools, libraries, and conventions.

**ROS 2 Bridge (Isaac Sim)**
: A component within Isaac Sim that enables communication between the simulation and external ROS 2 nodes.

**Rviz2**
: A 3D visualization tool for ROS 2 that allows users to view sensor data, robot models, maps, and other information.

**Service (ROS 2)**
: A request/reply communication model in ROS 2 used for synchronous, one-time transactions between a client and a server.

**Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**
: The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

**Speech-to-Text (STT)**
: The process of converting spoken language into written text.

**Subscriber (ROS 2)**
: A ROS 2 node that receives messages from a specific topic.

**Synthetic Data Generation**
: The process of creating artificial data, often in simulation, to train AI models, especially useful when real-world data is scarce or costly.

**Topic (ROS 2)**
: A named bus over which ROS 2 nodes exchange messages in a publish/subscribe communication model.

**Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)**
: An XML format in ROS 2 for describing all elements of a robot, including its kinematic and dynamic properties.

**Unity**
: A real-time 3D development platform used for game development, and increasingly for robotics simulation, especially for human-robot interaction and realistic rendering.

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems**
: Robotic systems that integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical action capabilities to allow robots to interpret and act on human commands in complex environments.

**Visual SLAM (VSLAM)**
: A type of SLAM that uses visual sensor data (e.g., from cameras) to build maps and localize the robot.
